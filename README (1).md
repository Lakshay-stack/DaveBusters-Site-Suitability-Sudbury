# 📍 Dave & Buster’s Site Suitability Analysis – Greater Sudbury

## 📖 Project Overview
This GIS project identifies **potential suitable sites** for constructing a Dave & Buster’s entertainment center/restaurant within the **City of Greater Sudbury**.  

Using **ArcGIS Pro** and spatial analysis techniques, multiple datasets were processed, queried, and combined to create a suitability map based on criteria such as:
- Elevation ranges
- Proximity to hotels/motels
- Population density
- Floodplain and environmental constraints
- Parcel zoning and size

The final output is an **interactive ArcGIS Web App** for easy visualization and exploration.
